        <h1>The Best Way to learn the Syntax Of Your Next Programming language!</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="post">
        <p>
        Everyone knows that the journey of becoming a software developer is challenging, but a rewarding one. 
        On my journey, it was apparent to me that the need for clarity and assurance was the main focus when beginning. 
        When people enter the world of programming, it is like traveling into outer space. 
        The stars and planets are all the technologies and concepts that we have to learn 
        and our space suit is the resources we can make use of.
        </p>
        <p>
        Usually, people who go into programming even people who are in school do not have a mentor. 
        I think that having a mentor that is in the field and is passionate about his/her craft is 
        the single biggest advantage one can have when learning programming. 
        After a lot of struggling one may be just starting to grasp their first programming language. 
        After becoming somewhat proficient in that language they may just decide that they would 
        need to learn a new language to move on with a project.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is especially the case when a front end developer realizes he needs to learn a backend language 
        like PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, or even Java. Some may say that it isn't necessary to get into a 
        completely different language since javascript can be used in the back end now because of node.js, 
        but I beg to differ.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is where the title of this post really shines. I am a Computer Science sophomore and in my school and I was taught
        C++. I was well informed that C++ was a very relevant language when it came to memory optimization and speed,
        but I knew I needed to learn how to build things. My goal from the start was becoming a web developer; 
        I learned HTML and CSS which gave me the ability to create static websites.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was a little intimidated by the fact I had to learn javascript sooner or later. 
        This was because in the past I had heard many people complain and say that javascript was hard and very weird to learn. 
        The thing is when it comes to learning new things, my approach is very unorthodox. 
        I always look for ways to optimize the learning process in whatever I do, 
        so that I can carry over that process in different situations.
        </p>
        <p>
        My crazy idea was that I should learn algorithms and data structures using javascript so that I could learn it. 
        The idea behind this was that it would get me to really dig deep into the language 
        and learn the real nitty and gritty things. The reason I thought this was possible is that each language has different
        nuances and cases and so by focusing on learning the different data structures and algorithms you have to 
        dig deep to understand what you are doing. A perfect example of this is how built-in sort methods have 
        different time complexities depending on what language they are used in. Specifically, in the case of javascript, 
        the time complexity and algorithm used in its built-in sort method will change from browser to browser because 
        different browsers use different sort methods.
        </p>
        <p>
        The ability to contrast the differences in languages also gives you enough context to really learn the concept in 
        another language. An example would be comparing a struct in C++ to an object in javascript or remembering 
        the logic you used to create a linked list in C++ and converting into javascript by only taking into consideration 
        the fact that javascript uses garbage collection to clear its memory and learning what the 'this.' the keyword means.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ultimately learning algorithms and data structures while also doing programming questions will accelerate the 
        process of learning the new language. The facts about javascript that I described above were all discovered 
        while learning data structures and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
        After learning data structures and algorithms, you could also try teaching them to your friends or 
        people who are generally looking to learn them. I have been recently doing videos on solving programming problems 
        on youtube using javascript. Explaining hard concepts to people reinforces your knowledge and challenges you to 
        really understand the material.
